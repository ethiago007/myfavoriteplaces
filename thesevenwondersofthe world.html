  <u><b><strong><h1>Seven Wonders Of The World</h1></strong></b></u>
    <p>In 2000 a Swiss foundation launched a campaign to determine the New Seven Wonders of the World. Given that the
        original Seven Wonders list was compiled in the 2nd century BCE—and that only one entrant is still standing (the
        Pyramids of Giza)—it seemed time for an update. And people around the world apparently agreed, as more than 100
        million votes were cast on the Internet or by text messaging. The final results, which were announced in 2007,
        were met with cheers as well as some jeers—a number of prominent contenders, such as Athens’s Acropolis, failed
        to make the cut.</p>
